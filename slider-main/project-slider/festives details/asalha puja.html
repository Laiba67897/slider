      <h1 class="eid-heading">Asalha Pooja</h1>
      <p>Asalha Puja is the day when Buddha chose his first disciple Kondanna who was also ordained as the first Buddhist monk. The day commemorates the first sermon delivered by Buddha after his enlightenment to the five ascetics at a forest near Varanasi. Asalha Puja, also known as Dharma Day, is one of Theravada Buddhism's most important festivals, celebrating as it does the Buddha's first sermon, the Sermon in the Deer Park at Sarnath, in which he set out to his five former associates the doctrine that had come to him following his enlightenment. 
        Asalha Puja is typically celebrated on a single day, which is the full moon day itself. However, the occasion is often followed by the Vassa period, also known as the Buddhist Lent or Rains Retreat, which begins the day after Asalha Puja and lasts for three lunar months. Asalha Puja Day also marks the start of a three-month mandatory retreat for monks. Buddhist people visit temples on this day to pray, meditate, listen to sermons, and give offerings. This is a day of new beginnings, renewal, and recommitment to the faith for Buddhists. Āsāḷha is a Theravada Buddhist festival which typically takes place in July, on the full moon of the Āsādha month.
