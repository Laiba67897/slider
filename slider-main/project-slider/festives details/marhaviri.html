      <h1 class="eid-heading">Marhaviri Festival</h1>
      <p>According to Jains,Â Mahavira was born in 599 BCE. His birth date falls on the thirteenth day of the rising moon in the month of Chaitra in the Vira Nirvana Samvat calendar era. It falls in March or April of the Gregorian calendar, and is celebrated by Jains as Mahavir Janma Kalyanak. Mahavir Jayanti is celebrated with great fervor by Jains around the globe. They carry out processions(rath yatra), visit temple, give offerings to the poor, meditate, and chant hymns in praise of Lord Mahavirs on this auspicious occasion. After Mahavira, one of his disciples Sudharma Svami is said to have taken over the leadership. He was the head of Jain community till 600 BCE. After his death, Jambuswami, a disciple of Sudharma Svami became the head of the monks. He was the head till 463 BCE.
        Mahavir was born in 599 B.C. as a prince in Bihar, India. At the age of 30, he left his family and royal household, gave up his worldly possessions, including clothing and become a monk. He spent the next twelve years in deep silence and meditation to conquer his desires and feelings.</p>
