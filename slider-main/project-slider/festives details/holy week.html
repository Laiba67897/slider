      <h1 class="eid-heading">Holly Week</h1>
      <p>Holy Week, in the Christian church, the week between Palm Sunday and Easter, observed with special solemnity as a time of devotion to the Passion of Jesus Christ. In the Greek and Roman liturgical books, it is called the Great Week because great deeds were done by God during this week.  Holy Week commemorates Jesus' last days and crucifixion (a form of cruel capital punishment where a person is nailed to a cross). Holy Week leads up to the celebration of Easter Sunday – the day Christians celebrate Jesus rising from the dead. Start by sharing about Jesus' entrance into Jerusalem for “Palm Sunday” followed by the Last Supper on Maundy Thursday and Jesus praying in the Garden of Gethsemane later that night. Then, explain how Jesus was crucified and died on Good Friday and was resurrected on Easter Sunday — known as Resurrection Day. It starts with Palm Sunday when Jesus enters the city of Jerusalem. The week leads through the Last Supper, His crucifixion, and ends on Easter Sunday with His resurrection. This is the basis of Christianity, His sacrifice launched the New Covenant God promised and many had prophesied throughout the Old Testament. In Western Christianity, Holy Week is the sixth and last week of Lent, beginning with Palm Sunday and concluding on Holy Saturday. The entry of Jesus and his disciples into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday marks the beginning of Holy Week, is the last week of Lent, between Palm Sunday and the dusk of Maundy Thursday.</p>
